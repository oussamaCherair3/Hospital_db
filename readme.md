## :broom: Data Cleaning & Standardization

During data inspection, the following patterns were identified and handled appropriately:

- Optional demographic fields (`suffix`, `maiden`, `zip`) contain `NULL` values, which were treated as valid and left unchanged.
- Categorical fields use abbreviated codes:
  - `marital`: `S` (Single), `M` (Married)
  - `gender`: `M` (Male), `F` (Female)
- These fields were standardized or interpreted consistently during analysis.
- Patient name fields contained non-alphabetic characters, indicating synthetic or unvalidated entries.
